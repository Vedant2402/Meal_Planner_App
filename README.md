Meal Planner Application

In this semester, you will develop and build a Meal Planner Application where users can create meal plans by searching and adding meals from the Spoonacular API. 
The application will be developed using Node.js with Express.js, MongoDB with Mongoose.js and Svelte.js. The development will take place over three homework assignments, progressively building the full application functionality.
